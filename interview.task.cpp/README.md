# Interview Task

This repository contains WIP project for candidates for Graphics Software Engineer Intern at Intel in Gda≈Ñsk.
Your task as candidate is to finish functionality and prepare some example data for tests.

## Task 1

Project has some structures defined in file `task\include\data.hpp` as well as interface for serialization of those structures to file in `task\include\serialization.hpp`.
Your first task is to implement that interface in file `task\source\serialization.cpp`.

### Requirements

- data should be stored in binary format
- if possible, you should avoid storing same data twice
- (de)serialization should be ready for future changes in data structures (also should be backward compatible)

## Task 2

This actually is rather subtask for [Task 1](#task-1) as you need to verify your code somehow.
In `task\source\main.cpp` prepare some example data, serialize and deserialize them and then verify results using interface from `task\include\verifier.hpp`.

### Requirements

- prepare different examples for different scenarios


## How to build

Project is configured that it works with MSVC on Windows and GCC on Linux using CMake for project configuration.
Repository also contains `CMakePresets.json` file that make CMake configuration easier and most convenient way to configure project is to use VSCode with proper configuration of CMake tools - [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/docs/cmake-presets.md) you can find details.

Project also has configuration for VSCode `devcontainer` with Docker container configured for Ubuntu.
You can use it to build Linux configuration if you prefer.
Instruction how to do it can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
